# Term 3 8 Queens Assignment by Bosco

I used this to prove that my pseudocode worked as intended

To build from source.

### Linux
I assume you already have clang or g++ setup just run either
`g++ ./queens.cpp -o ./queens`
Or
`clang++ ./queens.cpp -o ./queens`

### Windows
You will probably need Visual Studio and it's MSVC compiler
Open the file with Visual Studio and let it compile

I recommend using MinGW, if you already have this setup, run 
`g++ ./queens.cpp -o ./queens.exe`
